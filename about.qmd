::: {.about_me style="align-text: left"}
Hi, I'm Gareth Edwards from Cape Town, South Africa. I am a Data Scientist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I've got my undergraduate degree in Bsc Computer Science and Applied Stats, BSc Honours in Computer Science and Bsc Masters in Data Science all from the University of Cape Town.

But really I just love football. Far from being young enough, or good enough to burst on to the scene like Micah Richards, I have decided to take the less flashy path and try my hand in football analytics instead and herein lies my attempt to get into the football business.

Take a look at my blogs as I dive into some football data analytics and data science. More blogs are to come!

Feel free to get in touch via twitter!
