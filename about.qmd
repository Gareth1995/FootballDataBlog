Hi, I'm Gareth Edwards from Cape Town, South Africa. I am a Data Scientist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I've got my undergraduate degree in Bsc Computer Science and Applied Stats, BSc Honours in Computer Science and Bsc Masters in Data Science all from the University of Cape Town.

But really I just love football. Far from being young enough, or good enough to burst on to the scene like Micah Richards, I have decided to take the less flashy path and try my hand in football analytics instead and herein lies my attempt to get into the football business.

Football, much like the world has been saturated in data to the point where we are drowning in it. Data Science is everywhere and new research on football is being done on every conceivable topic of the game. While data is great and gives us the tools to view patterns not apparent to the human eye, we also run the risk of working so hard at the data that we end up forgetting what the goal was in the first place.

So, here's what I propose, lets keep it simple... Please. Boil it down, take a step back, see the bigger picture. As scientists we love to sound smart and look smart and feel smart but at the end of the day, all the smarts is nothing if nobody else understands you. Football is a beautiful game, but it also, just a game. The more we complicate anything in life, the more complicated life becomes.

What I have seen in football analytics so far, bar a few groundbreaking pieces of work (thank you Karun), is just a whole lot of over complication. In my series of blog posts I aim to keep it simple and concise. My approach is to start with the bigger picture and then work my way to the data from there. There is no use finding problems for the sake of solving problems (the way of many a scientist).

So, take a look through my blogs and I hope you see the value and appreciate the simplcity in the work! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to chat or even to offer some constructive criticism. I am all ears.
